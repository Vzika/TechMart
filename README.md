### Placing an Order

To place an order, send a POST request to `/orders` with the required order details.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/orders \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "customer_name": "John Doe",
  "customer_email": "johndoe@yahooe.com",
  "product_id": 1,
  "quantity": 2,
  "status": "Pending"
}'
```

### Adding a Product

To add a new product to the store, send a POST request to `/add_products` with the product details.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/add_products \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "New Laptop",
  "description": "A high-performance laptop",
  "price": 1500
}'
```

### Getting All Products

To retrieve the list of available products, send a GET request to `/product`.

```bash

```

### Adding a Comment

To leave a comment on a product, send a POST request to `/add_comment` with the comment details.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/add_comment \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "product_id": 2,
  "customer_name": "Zika Charles",
  "comment_text": "Hey TechMart, I love your products."
}'
```

### User Signup

To create a new user account, send a POST request to `/signUp` with the user's details.

-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-b cookies.txt
```
